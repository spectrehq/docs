- Deployed program (coming soon)

The ACL Manager program defines several roles used across the Spectre protocol family. It uses the [access control](./access_control.md) system. In practice, almost all programs in Spectre will use the ACL Manager to check roles and permissions.

We do not list the predefined roles and checking transitions here. You should refer to the source code for the full list of roles and checking transitions.
