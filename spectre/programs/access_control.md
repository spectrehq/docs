- Deployed program (coming soon)

Access control, that is, "who is allowed to do this thing", is incredibly important in the world of decentralized programs. The access control of your program may govern who can mint tokens, vote on proposals, freeze transfers, and many other things. It is therefore critical to understand how you implement it, lest someone else steals your whole system. We implement access control in a way that is both secure and flexible, which is called role-based access control (RBAC).

Role-based access control is a policy-neutral access control mechanism defined around roles and privileges.
In essence, we will be defining multiple _roles_, each allowed to perform different sets of actions. An account may have, for example, 'moderator', 'minter' or 'admin' roles, which you will then check for. This check can be enforced through the `only_role` or `check_role` transition. Separately, you will be able to define rules for how accounts can be granted a role, have it revoked, and more.

Every role has an associated admin role, which grants permission to call the `grant_role` and `revoke_role` transitions. A role can be granted or revoked by using these if the calling account has the corresponding admin role. Multiple roles may have the same admin role to make management easier. A roleâ€™s admin can even be the same role itself, which would cause accounts with that role to be able to also grant and revoke it.

This mechanism can be used to create complex permissioning structures resembling organizational charts, but it also provides an easy way to manage simpler applications. The program includes a special role, called `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` (with value `0u8`), which acts as the default admin role for all roles. An account with this role will be able to manage any other role, unless `set_role_admin` is used to select a new admin role.

## Mappings, Structs and Records

All the mappings can be read publicly, either by the user or by the programs.

#### grants

Returns whether the account has the role.
The key is the BHP256 hash of the `grant` struct instance.

```Leo
struct grant {
    account: address,
    role: u8,
}

mapping grants: field => bool;
```

#### role_admins

Returns the admin role of the role.
Role is represented by a `u8` number.

```Leo
mapping role_admins: u8 => u8;
```

#### initialized

Returns whether the mapping has been initialized.
The only valid key is `0u8`.

```Leo
mapping initialized: u8 => bool;
```

## Transitions

#### only_role

Check whether the caller has the role.
If not, the transition will fail.

```Leo
async transition only_role(public role: u8) -> Future;
```

#### check_role

Check whether the account has the role.
If not, the transition will fail.

```Leo
async transition check_role(public role: u8, public account: address) -> Future;
```

#### check_role_admin

Check whether the `account` account has the admin role of the `role` role.

```Leo
async transition check_role_admin(public role: u8, public account: address) -> Future;
```

#### set_role_admin

Set `admin_role` as the admin role of the `role` role.
The caller must have the `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` role.

```Leo
async transition set_role_admin(public role: u8, public admin_role: u8) -> Future;
```

#### grant_role

Grant the `role` role to the `account` account.

```Leo
async transition grant_role(public role: u8, public account: address) -> Future;
```

#### revoke_role

Revoke the `role` role from the `account` account.

```Leo
async transition revoke_role(public role: u8, public account: address) -> Future;
```

#### renounce_role

Renounce the `role` role from the `account` account.
The `account` must be the caller itself. That is, only the caller can renounce its own role.

```Leo
async transition renounce_role(public role: u8, public account: address) -> Future;
```

## Admin Transitions

The following transitions can only be called by the admin.
The admin should be an administrator program, which is managed by the Spectre Governance.

#### initialize

Initializes the access control program.
It will grant the `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` role to the caller.
Actually, the caller address must be the same as the constant `INITIAL_ADMIN` written in the program before deployment.

```Leo
async transition initialize() -> Future;
```
