## What is SPT?

**SPT** is a governance token used for the Spectre Governance's voting process (both off-chain and on-chain). We believe that the SPT token will contribute to our ecosystem through a few key functions:

- Enabling decentralisation and governance of the Spectre protocols which will ensure that these core primitives remain neutral and fairly operated.

- Aligning incentives between ecosystem partners, users and protocol contributors.

- Bootstrapping key network effects for the Spectre ecosystem.

## Token Allocation

Spectre's success is only due to the community of users and builders that contribute to the ecosystem.
A significant portion of SPT tokens, will be airdropped to the community through the [Points Incentive Campaigns](points.md). Users can accumulate points which will later determine their share in the SPT token generation event (TGE).
