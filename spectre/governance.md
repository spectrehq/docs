The Spectre Governance manages the suite of liquidity protocols by deciding on key parameters through the voting power of the [governance token (SPT)](tokenomics.md) holders.
Our governance system forms a crucial part of the Spectre ecosystem. It enables the community members to participate actively in the decision-making processes, shaping the future of the platform.

## Governance Power

SPT token holders receive governance powers proportional to their balances on the Aleo network.

There are two powers associated with each governance token:

- The proposal power that gives access to creating a proposal.

- The voting power which is used to vote for or against active proposals.

Governance powers can be either jointly or separately delegated to any Aleo account.
