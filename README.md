# ðŸŽ‰ Welcome to Spectre

## What is Spectre?

Spectre is a suite of liquidity protocols built on **Aleo**.
Its goal is to provide users with open, fair, and secure **ZeFi** products while maintaining privacy and regulatory compliance.

We are currently developing or planning several ZeFi products as follows:

- **AleoStaking**. A liquid staking protocol that allows users to stake their Aleo Credits and earn rewards.
- **AleoLending**. A lending protocol that allows users to collateralize their assets and borrow other assets.

## AleoStaking

AleoStaking is the liquid staking solution for Aleo.
We let users lock up their Aleo Credits to help validators participate in consensus and secure the Aleo network.
They earn rewards on their staked Credits.
By staking with AleoStaking your Credits remain liquid and can be used across a range of ZeFi applications, getting extra rewards.

- **Staking pool**. Protocol to manage deposits, staking rewards, and withdrawals.
- **stCredits**. Unlike staked Credits, the AleoStaking stCredits are freely transferable instead of locked as in the case of native staking.
AleoStaking lets users operate with staked Credits by leveraging collateral, lending, farming, and other kinds of ZeFi protocols.
- **Governance**. AleoStaking liquid protocols management entity, responsible for picking validators for bonding, configuring the protocol parameters and much more.
- **Operator**. A daemon service for monitoring validators and our delegator programs, bonding and unbonding Credits, and feeding near realtime staking rewards data.
