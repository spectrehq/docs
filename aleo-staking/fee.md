AleoStaking applies a 5%~10% fee on staking rewards that are split between validators and the AleoStaking treasury. The fee can be changed by the Governance pending a successful vote. Validators receive this fee for the services that they provide. The AleoStaking treasury will use this fee to incentivise partner protocols and integrations.

In order to distribute the fee, we will mint additional stCredits every time the AleoStaking operator service initiates an Aleo native bonding/unbonding transaction for users' staking/unstaking.
