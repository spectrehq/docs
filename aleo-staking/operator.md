The **Operator** daemon service is responsible for signing operating transactions on behalf of the AleoStaking protocol. The signing account has the `STAKING_OPERATOR_ROLE` role in our [ACL manager](../spectre/programs/acl_manager.md) program. Its private key will come from the `STAKING_OPERATOR_PRIVATE_KEY` environment variable when the [operator daemon service](https://github.com/spectrehq/spectre/blob/main/packages/leo/script/operate.ts) is started.
