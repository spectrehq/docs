stCredits stands for AleoStaking Staked Credits. It is an ARC-20 value-accruing token wrapper for staked Aleo Credits. stCredits are freely transferable and can be used across a range of ZeFi applications, getting extra rewards.

At initialisation, 1 stCredits will represent 1 Credits staked. This ratio will increase every block, meaning 1 stCredits will represent more than 1 Credits soon after launch. Over time the stCredits will be worth (and redeemable) for more and more Credits as yield accrues.

stCredits will be deeply integrated in ZeFi ensuring that it is as easy to use as possible and widely adopted, offering as much utility as Aleo Credits itself.
